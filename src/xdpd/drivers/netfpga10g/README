The NetFPGA-10G driver 
======================

Brief
-----

The content of this folder is the implementation of the NetFPGA-10G Openflow switch (HAL-compliant) driver. The driver is currently based on the HW implementation that can be found under the Beta NetFPGA 10G repository under the folder:
	
	NetFPGA-10G-live/contrib-projects/openflow_switch/   

Written by Tatsuya Yabe (et al.?).

Since this implementation is only OF1.0 compliant, the driver is currently exposing itself as a _very_ restricted OF1.2 compliant driver. Limitations are currently:

- Only supports 1.0 matches, wildcards and actions.
- The pipeline can ONLY contain 1 table
- Only one logical switch can be created, and never destroyed.
- Ports are attached on switch creation; subsequent calls to attach/detach are silently ignored. 
	
Most of the implementation of this driver was done during the NetFPGA camp 2013 in Poznan, an event co-organized by ALIEN FP7 project.
	
The initial port was taking as a reference the (software) implementation made by eastzone:

https://github.com/eastzone/openflow/tree/netfpga-10g		

As well as the HW FPGA code itself.


Comments
--------
	
!!!!!STRONG WARNING!!!!! This driver is experimental 
	
This driver uses ROFL-pipeline to maintain the cache of the HW entries (exact and wildcarded). 

We expect to see more contributions and improvements on both SW and HW implementations of the openflow_switch implementation, as the NetFPGA 10G community grows. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you wish to contribute.
