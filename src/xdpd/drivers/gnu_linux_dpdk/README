The GNU/Linux DPDK driver 
================================

Brief
-----

Platform driver using Intel's DPDK 

Requirements
------------

DPDK v1.6

Comments
--------

To compile xDPd with DPDK support, make sure it is configured like this (if libraries are not installed):

	CFLAGS="-L$RTE_SDK/lib/ -I$RTE_SDK/include/" CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS" ../configure --with-hw-support=gnu-linux-dpdk --disable-silent-rules 

Note also that _before_ compiling, the file src/config.h should be revised to make sure that at least:

- IO_IFACE_NUM_QUEUES, RX_XXTHRESH and TX_XXTHRESH are correct according to your NIC's capabilities
- Core mask is at least 3 (2 cores)

To execute xdpd use the normal config file. Note that DPDK's driver will discover 1G ports as geXX and 10G as 10geXX.

Limitations
-----------

Note that current config.h cannot handle multiple configurations of ports and RX/TX thresholds. This will be fixed in following version
