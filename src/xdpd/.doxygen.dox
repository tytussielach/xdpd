*
* @section intro_sec Introduction
* 
* The eXtensible DataPath daemon (xDPd) is a multi-platform, multi OF version, open-source datapath built focussing on <b>performance</b> and <b>extensibility</b>. xDPd can also be considered <i>a framework for building OpenFlow datapath elements</i>, as it is designed to be easily extended with the support of new forwarding devices. 
*
* The areas in which xDPd can be extended are mainly:
*
* - New platforms: network processors, FPGAs, ASICs.. as well as non-ethernet devices
* - New OpenFlow versions (without breaking or disabling existing ones!)
* - New OpenFlow extensions (header matches, actions...)
* - Support multiple management interfaces or RPCs (OFConfig, CLI, AMQP, Netconf...)
*
* xDPd is written in C/C++. It uses extensibly the Revised OpenFlow Libary (ROFL) libraries, mainly for OpenFlow endpoint management (ROFL-common) and as a forwarding plane engine (ROFL-pipeline).
