Introduction
============

The plugin system allows xDPd to add modules at configure time.

How to create a plugin
======================

In order to create a plugin follow this (6) step guide:

0) Choose an appropriate name for the plugin. For this guide we will use "my_plugin" example.

1) The M4 files, one per plugin are located under config/ folder in the root directory. Copy the skeleton to plugin_my_plugin.m4. 

Open the file and substitute PLUGIN_NAME for MY_PLUGIN, and plugin_name for my_plugin. This piece will end up being included in the configure.ac, so you can use the normal autoconf MACROS. Add necessary AC_CONFIG_FILES according to your internal structure within the plugin (Makefile.am/Makefile)

WARNING: do NOT overwrite CPPFLAGS, LDFALGS, CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS or any other wide-scope variable

2) Open plugins.m4 and add the call ADD_PLUGIN(my_plugin) to the end of the file.

3) Go to src/xdpd/management/plugins/ and copy example folder:

	cp -r example/ my_plugin

4) Modify the internal code of the plugin. At least rename the file example.h/cc to my_plugin.h/cc and the plugin class defined there. Add additional logic

5) Edit Plugin.am, and substitute EXAMPLE for MY_PLUGIN and example for my_plugin

4) Add the following code to plugin_manager_loader.cc

	#ifdef WITH_MGMT_MY_PLUGIN
	   #include "my_plugin/my_plugin.h"
	#endif

And register the plugin; note that the position in the plugin_manager::pre_init() method
matters, so you will have to place where it logically fits:

	#ifdef WITH_MGMT_MY_PLUGIN
	    //Register MY_PLUGIN
	    register_plugin(new my_plugin());
	#endif

5) Add the following line at the end of src/xdpd/management/plugins/Makefile.am:

	include my_plugin/Plugin.ma 

6) Run autogen.sh again and you are ready to recompile. Your plugin can be compiled by configuring xdpd with:

	../configure --with-plugins="my_plugin [other plugins]" 

Notes
=====

When creating new plugins it is sometimes useful to enable the verbose output by autotools. Run:

	../configure --with-plugins="..." --disable-silent-rules.


Take always example plugin as a reference.
